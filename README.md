# ColumnMerge

This is example code from a mixed model factorial design (between-subject and within-subject) and from a text analysis project.

Combining columns: I collected data using Qualtrics and had men and women see different intstructions (names of a competitor were changed to match the same sex as the participant). After that, all the questions were the same but since I used branching in qualtrics, I had seperate columns for men and women on the same items. I wanted to combine columns to have response column that included both men and women.

Column merger: I had a project where I asked paritcipants to give me five examples of cyberbullying. I was interested in analyzing the words used by men and women, but not looking at differences between examples within individuals. One way to solve this was to merge the columns together.
